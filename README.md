# House-Price-Estimator
The boom of the Sydney housing market in recent years has been fueled by a chronic
undersupply of housing, strong demand from a growing population and high
investor activity. Over the past 20 years from 2005 to 2025, the median house price
in Sydney has inreased by roughly 3.2 times, with current median prices exceeding
1.57 million. As housing affordability continues to be a major economic and social
concern, the ability to accurately estimate property values has becomes increasingly
important.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for Sydney house sale prices
using supervised machine learning techniques implemented in Python with the
scikit-learn library. The model analyses housing and suburb data to fluctuate
sales prices from property attributes, such as size, number of rooms, and location.

Multiple models are evaluated and compared to understand the trade off between
complexity, predictive accuracy and interpretability. The final outcome is a
modelling pipeline that addresses a real-world economic problem.
